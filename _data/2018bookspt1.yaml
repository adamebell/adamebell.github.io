- bintihome:
  title: "Binti:Home"
  author: "Nnedi Okorafor"
  synopsis: |
    This is the second book in the excellent <i>Binti</i> trilogy. I received the first novella for Christmas in 2017 and read it in the car ride home. The series takes place in a future where Earth's human inhabitants have made contact with civilizations on other planets. Binti is a Himba girl who was accepted to Oomza Uni, which is somewhere out in space. The first book, <i>Binti</i>, follows Binti's tumultuous journey from home to Oomza. 
    I was excited to find out that the sequel, <i>Binti: Home</i>, was already out (and that the third and final book <i>Binti: The Night Masquerade</i> was on the way) and so picked it up as soon as possible.

- fish:
  title: "What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins"
  author: "Jonathan Balcombe"
  synopsis: |
    A non-fiction book that walks through various scientific endeavours and anecdotes about the cognitive abilities of various species of fish. Balcombe walks of fishy life, with chapters on what fish perceive, feel, and think as well as different ways they recognize each other (as well as humans). Sprinkled within are passages that paint the tragedy of this; humans are destroying the oceans at alarming rates, so we may never truly explore the vast potential that ocean life holds.
