- bintihome:
  title: "Binti:Home"
  author: "Nnedi Okorafor"
  synopsis: |
    This is the second book in the excellent <i>Binti</i> trilogy. I received the first novella for Christmas in 2017 and read it in the car ride home. The series takes place in a future where Earth's human inhabitants have made contact with civilizations on other planets. Binti is a Himba girl who was accepted to Oomza Uni, located somewhere out in space. The first book, <i>Binti</i>, follows her tumultuous journey from home to Oomza. 
    I was excited to find out that the sequel, <i>Binti: Home</i>, was already out (and that the third and final book <i>Binti: The Night Masquerade</i> was on the way) and so picked it up as soon as possible. </p>
    <p>This book continues building on the wonderful sci-fi future that Okorafor started in the first installment, rife with intergalactic conflict and wild new technologies. After a short slice of Binti's life at Oomza, she boards a spaceship to return home for her pilgrammage. The story that follows is one of returning home after a long time away and experiencing the familiar through an unfamiliar lens. Binti has changed in many ways during her trip, but her home remains relatively unchanged and not necessarily accepting of who she has become. </p>
    <p>I left my home in the suburbs of Pittsburgh for college in 2010, and then moved halfway across the country for a job when I graduated. After a couple of years, I moved back to Pittsburgh for another job. While I haven't brokered galactic peace or gotten any extra-terrestrial DNA mixed up with my own, I had definitely changed as a person in those six years, and it can be weird moving back to a place that may be expecting a different version of you.

- fish:
  title: "What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins"
  author: "Jonathan Balcombe"
  synopsis: |
    A non-fiction book that walks through various scientific endeavours and anecdotes about the cognitive abilities of various species of fish. Balcombe walks of fishy life, with chapters on what fish perceive, feel, and think as well as different ways they recognize each other (as well as humans). Sprinkled within are passages that paint the tragedy of this; humans are destroying the oceans at alarming rates, so we may never truly explore the vast potential that ocean life holds.
