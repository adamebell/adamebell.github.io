- fish:
  title: "What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins"
  author: "Jonathan Balcombe"
  synopsis: |
    "A non-fiction book that walks through various scientific endeavours and anecdotes about the cognitive abilities of various species of fish. Balcombe walks of fishy life, with chapters on what fish perceive, feel, and think as well as different ways they recognize each other (as well as humans). Sprinkled within are passages that paint the tragedy of this; humans are destroying the oceans at alarming rates, so we may never truly explore the vast potential that ocean life holds."
  reaction:
    - "Fish are neat."
