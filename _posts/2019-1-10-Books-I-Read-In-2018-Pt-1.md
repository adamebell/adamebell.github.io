summary: I start recounting the books I read in 2018 and some brief thoughts on each.
---
At the start of 2018, I set a goal to try to read a book on average each week. I didn't quite make it to 52, but I read more books than I probably would have otherwise. 

I very much go in cycles with my reading - some months I will read well over one per week and other months I barely read at all. It really depends on how well a book can get its hooks into me. Often, once I finish a book or series, it can be difficult for me to pick anything else up for a while.

I didn't finish many non-fiction books last year. Reading non-fiction books in anything but short bursts is typically difficult for me. I enjoy the way that these books present an opportunity to learn in a much more in depth way than normal about a single topic, but there's only so much of one topic that I can keep focus on for a long time. So I hop in and out of these, which is why they won't feature too heavily in these posts.

Tabletop Roleplaying corebooks made up a large portion of my 2018 completions which is something I wouldn't have expected. I've been very into playing different types of board games for about five years now, but in the RPG world had only played Dungeons and Dragons (briefly 4e and a fair amount of 5e), a small stint in Pathfinder, and a couple of sessions of Fiasco. In 2017, I started running my very first game of D&D and found myself enjoying that aspect of the hobby a lot more than I thought I would, but always had this sense that maybe I didn't like the mechanics as much. 2018 was the year that that started to change.

I didn't record the date that I finished each book, so the following overviews are presented only vaguely in the order that I completed them.
