title: What is this going to be?
---

First off I'd like to say hello to the void that I'll be sending these posts to. I've set this site up as a way to force myself into doing some writing, and there's no plan to promote it to get readers or anything like that. I'm mostly doing this because the act of publishing something feels like a good motivation to start doing some short writing - having a tangible¹ product at the end of the day feels like an accomplishment and thus something to come back and contribute to again and again.

That's the theory, anyway. If you're someone who happens to be reading this in January 2019 when I'm getting this started, then go ahead and stay tuned to see if I stick with it. If you're here much later than that, well, you're surrounded by the evidence that I did or didn't stick with it.

Here are a topics that might show up here:

## Game Design
I really enjoy playing board games, video games, and tabletop RPGs, and also have a fondness for the way the systems that those games are designed around come together to facilitate different types of "fun", which is a word used very broadly here. Some games provide a raucous sort of fun, like the session of *Dungeon World* I ran recently where the adventurers punched their way out of the bottom of a boat because of a precedent I set while forgetting that the majority of boats exist underwater. However, this isn't the only type of "fun" games can provide. Chunky euro-style board games just burn your brain up but are still an enjoyable use of your time. Video games like *Papers, Please* provide no opportunites or reasons for their players to smile, but still qualify as "fun" in the sense that I'm using the word here³.

What I meant to lead to here is that for the past year or two I've become increasingly interested in designing my own games. I've participated in two game jams so far and had a hand in producing two board games which were at least decent, and would like to do that more outside the context of a game jam. I'll probably do some write ups on what my thought process is or what kind of games I'm trying to make on here.

## Short Fiction?
The only fiction writing I've done up until now has been preparation for various tabletop RPGs. That's something I'd like to change, and so might be posting some stuff here just to get it out into the world.

## Photography
I like taking pictures. I typically prefer to take pictures of people and animals, but need to work on my other forms.

## Video production
I've had a green screen hung up in my apartment for maybe 3 years now and still haven't produced a finished video with the damn thing. This year I'd like to change that, and maybe I'll talk about it here.

## Web design
This website design is currently taken directly from the GitHub for Jekyll Now. I'd like to figure out how Jekyll works and configure this thing to meet my needs<sup>3</sup>. Once I'm done with that, I'll move on to setting up bicyclingbear.com where I will hopefully be posting videos and other content creating with my partner related to games and why we play them.

Well, that about wraps up this introduction. Thank you for reading this if you made it this far. I will hopefully be around to get more of my thoughts out of my own head.

¹Insofar as anything posted on the internet can be "tangible".

²Probably I will have a full write up at some point trying to explore my thoughts on this since I immediately started rambling on the topic.

³Which means I should probably figure out what the hell I actually want to do with this site.
