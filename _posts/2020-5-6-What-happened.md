Hello again. Approximately 17 months ago, I set up this website. I spent a good couple of weeks learning HTML, figuring out how to use github pages to host a website for free, and configuring it to approximately my liking. Hell, I even made a comment section that bots have been spamming ever since.

Perhaps at that point, I liked the idea of making a website where I could share some writing I might do, and the actual writing was secondary. In hindsight at least that appears to be the case. Whatever might have happened, I thought I'd post an update here to just mention what I've been up to.

2019 was an alright year for me. I switched jobs in the company I work for, and I didn't move apartments when my lease was up for the first time in 8 years. The stability is weird, but nice.

I also designed my first small tabletop RPG a month or two after making this site, called "That's Enough Chatter. Let's See Who The Best Wizard Is, Shall We?". [You can download it for free here](https://adamebell.itch.io/enough-chatter "adamebell.itch.io"). It's a silly little party game where everyone plays a bunch of wizards whose spellbooks got all messed up, completing trials within an arena. I haven't played it yet, and I assume nobody else has either. I'm proud of it, though, because it started me down the path of exploring RPG design.

The next game I made is called No Stone Unturned. I designed it on and off over the course of 2019, and then I ran a [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adamebell/no-stone-unturned-zinequest) as a part of Zine Quest 2 this February. While editing and finalizing No Stone Unturned, a third game leaked out of my brain. I ended up calling it [Uneasy Lies the Head](https://adamebell.itch.io/uneasy-lies-the-head).

I'm really proud of both of these games and have had a lot of fun playing them so far. I'll be shipping physical copies of No Stone Unturned to about 100 people who backed on kickstarter, which is wild and cool and exciting.

There are other things that have happened to me in the past year, of course, but I'll stop here for now. I won't make any promises like I did in the first post to myself or my imaginary reading audience about continuing to write here, but I'll try to keep it in mind. I'll be stuck inside for the forseeable future, what with the global pandemic occuring right now, so who knows what I'll get up to.

In the meantime, if you're reading this, thank you and I hope you have a lovely day.
