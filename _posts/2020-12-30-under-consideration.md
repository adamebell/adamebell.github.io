I'm probably going to blow up this site from orbit and completely redo it soon - now that i've actually made games and videos and stuff I can just use this site as more of a static thing where all my work lives that i can point to. Maybe one day get a little store going where you can buy my baubles.

If you're someone who has visited and read anything here, that's cool! Sorry I never actually used it or provided anything of value. Stay tuned for something at some point, though I'm not going to prioritize it.
